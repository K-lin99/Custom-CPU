# Custom-CPU
Designed CPU as part of  Computer Architecture and Design course.

Design follows a Von Neumann style with unified control flow and unified datapath.

Over 20 MIPS instructions were implemented using CPU components such as a custom ALU, decode unit, next-adress logic, instruction cache and data cache.

Design was verified on ModelSim with over 100 instruction sequences and deployed on a Nexys A7 FPGA via Vivado.
